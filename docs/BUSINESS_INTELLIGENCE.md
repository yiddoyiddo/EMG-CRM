### Database Schema

#### Performance Metrics
```sql
-- Activity tracking for calls and agreements
SELECT 
  u.name,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN al.activityType = 'call' THEN 1 END) as calls_week,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN pi.agreementDate IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as agreements_week,
  (COUNT(CASE WHEN pi.agreementDate IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) / 
   NULLIF(COUNT(CASE WHEN al.activityType = 'call' THEN 1 END), 0) * 100) as conversion_rate
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN activity_logs al ON u.id = al.bdrId
LEFT JOIN pipeline_items pi ON u.id = pi.bdrId
WHERE u.role = 'BDR'
GROUP BY u.id, u.name
```

#### Notification System
```sql
-- Notification tracking
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  type ENUM('success', 'warning', 'error', 'info'),
  title VARCHAR(255),
  message TEXT,
  timestamp DATETIME,
  read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  priority ENUM('low', 'medium', 'high'),
  userId VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Components
