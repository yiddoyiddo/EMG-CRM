1. **Start creating a lead** as usual in `/leads/new`
2. **Type contact details** (name, email, company, phone)
3. **See real-time checking** - loading indicators show when the system is checking
4. **Review warnings** if duplicates are found - you'll see:
   - Company/contact that was previously contacted
   - When it was last contacted and by whom
   - Confidence level of the match (percentage)
5. **Make decision** - choose to proceed anyway or cancel and modify

### **For Managers and Team Leads**
