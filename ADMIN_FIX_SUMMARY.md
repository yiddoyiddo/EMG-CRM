# Admin User Visibility Fix Summary

## Problem Diagnosed
The admin user couldn't see any leads, pipeline items, or data in the CRM system due to several issues:

1. **No leads in database** - The database was empty of leads
2. **Authentication system not working** - The auth system wasn't checking against the database
3. **Admin user password issue** - The admin user's password wasn't properly set
4. **Missing data restoration** - Backup data needed to be restored

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Data Restoration ✅
- **Restored 325 leads** from backup file `data-backup-1753726495118.json`
- **Restored 289 pipeline items** (some skipped due to missing BDR users)
- **Restored 292 activity logs** (some skipped due to missing BDR users)
- Created proper user ID mapping for foreign key relationships

### 2. Authentication System Fixed ✅
- Updated `src/lib/auth-options.ts` to properly check against database
- Added password verification using bcrypt
- Added role-based session management
- Fixed NextAuth callbacks to include user role

### 3. Admin User Setup ✅
- Created admin user: `admin@emg.com` with ADMIN role
- Fixed password: `admin123`
- Verified admin user can access all data

### 4. API Routes Verified ✅
- All API routes (`/api/leads`, `/api/pipeline`, `/api/finance`) properly handle role-based access
- Admin users can see all data
- BDR users can only see their own data

## Current Database State

### Users (7 total)
- **Admin Users (2)**
  - `admin@emg.com` - Role: ADMIN ✅
  - `dan.reeves@busenq.com` - Role: ADMIN ✅
- **BDR Users (5)**
  - `naeem.patel@emg.com` - Role: BDR
  - `jennifer.davies@emg.com` - Role: BDR
  - `mark.cawston@emg.com` - Role: BDR
  - `rupert.kay@emg.com` - Role: BDR
  - `verity.kay@emg.com` - Role: BDR

### Data
- **Leads**: 325 ✅
- **Pipeline Items**: 289 ✅
- **Activity Logs**: 292 ✅
- **Finance Entries**: 0 (no finance data in backup)

## Login Credentials

### Admin User
- **Email**: `admin@emg.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Role**: ADMIN
- **Access**: Can see all leads, pipeline items, and activity logs

## Testing Results

✅ **Authentication**: Admin login works correctly
✅ **Data Access**: Admin can see all 325 leads
✅ **Role-Based Access**: API routes properly filter data based on user role
✅ **Password Security**: bcrypt password hashing working correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application** by logging in as admin at `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Verify all sections** (Leads, Pipeline, Reporting, Finance) show data
3. **Test BDR users** to ensure they only see their own data
4. **Add finance data** if needed (currently no finance entries in backup)

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/auth-options.ts` - Fixed authentication
- `scripts/restore-with-user-mapping.ts` - Created data restoration script
- `scripts/create-admin-user.ts` - Created admin user
- `scripts/fix-admin-password.ts` - Fixed admin password
- `scripts/test-admin-login.ts` - Created testing script

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Login with admin credentials
Email: admin@emg.com
Password: admin123
```

The admin user should now be able to see all leads, pipeline items, and data in the CRM system.
